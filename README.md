# INtrack

INtrack is an internet crawler used for scanning the entire internet for vulnerabilities, technologies, exposures and more. It can gather IP addresses from the internet across the globe worldwide and run scans on them simultaneously. It can also run scans on targets based on their open ports or targets stored in a file you wish to scan. INtrack is still being developed so changes will be made as time goes on. You can use this tool now, but stay tuned for any updates being made.
